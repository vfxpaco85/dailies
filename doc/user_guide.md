## Features

### 1. **Input Fields for Video Information**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the Dailies Tool UI, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) for solutions to common problems.

## Code Overview

Hereâ€™s an overview of the relevant code for interacting with the tool:

### 1. **Setting Up the Logging**
The logging configuration is set up at the beginning of the `ui.py` file. This ensures that all user input is logged for debugging and tracking.

```python
# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,  # Set the default logging level to INFO
    format=LOG_FORMAT,
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(),  # Log to the console
        logging.FileHandler(LOG_FILE_PATH)  # Log to the log file
    ]
)
```

### 2. **Creating the UI**
The UI is created using **PySide6**, a Python binding for Qt. The layout is composed of multiple input fields, dropdowns, and buttons, as described earlier.

```python
# Example UI layout for form and render settings
form_layout = QFormLayout()
self.path_input = QLineEdit(self)  # Path input field
self.browse_button = QPushButton("Browse...", self)  # Browse button
self.browse_button.clicked.connect(self.browse_file)  # Connect to file dialog
```

### 3. **Handling Form Submission**
When the user clicks the **Submit** button, the form data is logged, and the application is ready for the next operation.

```python
def on_submit(self):
    """Handles the submission of the form data, logging all fields."""
    # Collect user input and log it
    logging.info(f"Path: {path}")
    logging.info(f"Version Name: {version}")
    logging.info(f"Description: {description}")
    # Log all other input fields...
    logging.info("Data submitted successfully!")
```

For more advanced usage, custom presets can be created and stored in the **presets** folder. These presets are loaded when the tool starts up and can be selected from the **Preset** dropdown.
